    "#'b': Binary mode is used when you want to read or write binary data. When used in combination with other modes, it should be appended as a suffix to the mode string. For example, 'wb' for write in binary mode, or 'rb' for read in binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "#'t': Text mode is used when you want to read or write text data. When used in combination with other modes, it should be appended as a suffix to the mode string. For example, 'wt' for write in text mode, or 'rt' for read in text mode.\n",

    "#Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "#The close() function is used to close a file in Python. It's important to close a file after we're done with it because it \n",
    "#frees up resources on your computer and ensures that the file's data is saved correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#When a file is opened, the operating system reserves a specific amount of memory to hold the file's contents and to keep track\n",
    "#of where you are in the file (known as the file pointer). This memory is not freed until the file is closed, which means that\n",
    "#if you open a large number of files without closing them, your computer could run out of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Furthermore, when you write to a file, the data is not immediately saved to the file on your hard drive. Instead, it's \n",
    "#temporarily stored in a buffer (a small area of memory) and is only saved to the file when the buffer is flushed (that is,\n",
    "#when it's full or when the file is closed). If we don't close the file, the data in the buffer may be lost if the program \n",
    "#terminates before the buffer is flushed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Therefore, it's a best practice to always close a file after we're done with it, to avoid running out of memory and to ensure \n",
    "#that the file's data is saved correctly. This can be done using the close() method, as shown in the example I provided in my \n",
